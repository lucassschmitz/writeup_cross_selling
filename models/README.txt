## Core Models

**Model 1**: Multi-product firms with switching costs. Two-period model where consumers choose a firm for product 1 (e.g., checking account) and later for product 2 (e.g., loan). Incur switching cost $s$ if changing firms between periods.

**Model 2**: Sharpe (1990) extended with switching costs à la von Thadden (2004). Firms seek sequential project financing. Inside banks observe project outcomes; outside banks don't. Switching between banks costs $\lambda$.

**Model 3**: Consumer mortgage choice with search costs. Consumers choose among lenders, with home bank offering differentiated value $\lambda$. Search cost $k$ to obtain quotes from additional lenders. Home bank has cost advantage $\Delta$ for cross-selling.
