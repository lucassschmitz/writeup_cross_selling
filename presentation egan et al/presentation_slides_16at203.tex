\section{Motivation and Questions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Motivation: ``Sleepy'' retail deposits}
Retail depositors rarely shop for better terms.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Account turnover is low: new checking/savings accounts are roughly 8--15\% of existing accounts per year (average life $\approx$ 8 years).
	\item Account closings are mostly idiosyncratic (e.g., inactivity, no longer needed, moving, death); only about 17\% of closures cite switching for better rates/services/fees.
	\item Estimated share inactive each year is very high ($\approx 94\%$).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why this matters}
Sleepiness changes the industrial organization of deposit markets.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Competition: does depositor inertia soften competition, or induce dynamic ``invest vs.\ harvest'' incentives that can also intensify competition for active depositors?
	\item Bank value: how much of the deposit franchise value is attributable to sleepy deposits?
	\item Financial stability: how does the deposit franchise buffer banks when rates rise?
	\item Policy relevance: regulators (e.g., UK FCA) have pushed for more pass-through of interest rates to depositors; what happens if deposit competition becomes effectively static?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{This paper: core questions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How sleepy are retail depositors, and how does sleepiness vary with rates and demographics?
	\item What does sleepiness imply for deposit market markups and their cyclicality?
	\item How does a dynamic view change the relationship between concentration and markups?
	\item How large is the deposit franchise value effect, and who benefits most?
	\item What happens under counterfactuals that eliminate sleepiness / dynamic competition?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Data and Stylized Facts}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Explain that the account types they study are: checking accounts, savings account, $10k and $25k money market accounts, 3 and 12 month certificates of deposit. But all the estimates usie the rates from the 10k money market account. 



\begin{frame}{Data sources}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Account-level turnover microdata from a core account processing platform: 89 banks/credit unions, 12 million deposit accounts.
	\item FDIC Summary of Deposits (SoD), 1994-2023: deposits at the bank$\times$county$\times$year level
	\item RateWatch (2001-June 2023): bank$\times$county$\times$year average rates by account type
	\item Call Reports: bank-level cost shifters (salary expenses, premises/fixed-asset expenses).
	\item Final estimation panel: 341{,}395 bank$\times$county$\times$year observations, 2002-2023 
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Deposit rates and spreads}
Paper’s baseline rate measure uses \textbf{\$10k money market deposit account} rates from RateWatch.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Deposit spread defined as $\rho_{jkt} := R_t^F - r_{jkt}$ (``price'' of deposit services).
	\item Summary stats (baseline sample):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $R_t^F$: federal funds rate
		\item Average deposit rate $\approx$ 34 bps.
		\item Average spread $R_t^F - r_{jkt} \approx$ 97 bps.
		\item Average market share per bank$\times$county observation $\approx$ 16\%.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	%\item 	Turnover rate (fraction of newly opened accounts) is roughly 8--15\% of existing accounts per year (life $\approx$ 8 years).
	
	\item Cross-sectional patterns suggest frictions (search/switching/inattention), not just persistent tastes

\section{Model}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Model overview}
Dynamic deposit market with \textbf{active vs.\ inactive} depositors.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each period depositors are either awake (active) or asleep (inactive).
	\item Active depositors choose a bank via discrete choice; inactive depositors keep last period’s bank.
	\item Banks set deposit rates/spreads dynamically to maximize franchise value.
	\item Sleepiness generates \textbf{invest vs.\ harvest} incentives:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Harvest: inertia lowers elasticity $\Rightarrow$ lower offered rates (higher spreads).
		\item Invest: capturing a depositor today raises future deposits (if they become inactive).
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Depositor utility and demand among active}
Active depositor $i$ choosing bank $j$ in market $k$ at time $t$:
\[
u_{ijkt} = \alpha \rho_{jkt} + \delta_{jkt} + \varepsilon_{ijkt},
\qquad \rho_{jkt} := R_t^F - r_{jkt},\quad \alpha < 0.
\]
With Type-I extreme value $\varepsilon_{ijkt}$, active market share:
\[
s^{Active}_{jkt} = \frac{\exp(\alpha \rho_{jkt} + \delta_{jkt})}{\sum_{\ell\in J_k}\exp(\alpha \rho_{\ell kt} + \delta_{\ell kt})}.
\]
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Sleepiness (inactivity) process}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Depositor activity status: $D_{it} = 1$ if active, $0$ if inactive.
	\item Activity given by: 
	\[
	D_{it}^* = S'_{k(i)t}\Gamma + X'_{it}\Theta + \eta_{it},
	\qquad D_{it} = 1(D_{it}^*>0).
	\]

	\item $S'_{k(i)t}:$ federal funds rate, 	$ X'_{it}:$

%I would have expected that the consumer is less sleepy the greater the switching payoff, but note that the federal funds rate cancels out at the moment of choosing bank, there is no ex-ante reason why it would affect sleepiness. 

	\item Market-level inactivity share:
	\[
	\phi_{kt} = 1 - \mathbb{E}[D_{it}\mid S_{kt}].
	\]

	\item Interpretation: reduced-form inattention / switching frictions; empirically $\phi_{kt}$ varies with rates and demographics.

\end{itemize}
 
 
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}{Total deposits: active + inactive components}
Total deposits held by bank $j$ in market $k$ at time $t$:
\[
Dep_{jkt} = (1-\phi_{kt})M_{kt}s^{Active}_{jkt}
\;+\;
\phi_{kt}(1+r_{jk,t-1})Dep_{jk,t-1}.
\]
\begin{itemize}
	\item Active flow: $(1-\phi_{kt})M_{kt}s^{Active}_{jkt}$.
	\item Inactive stock: last period deposits roll over and earn interest.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Banks: flow profits and franchise value}
Banks invest deposits at bank-level return $R_{jt}$ and pay deposit rate $r_{jkt}$ and marginal servicing cost $c_{jkt}$.
\[
\pi_{jt}=\sum_{k\in K} Dep_{jkt}\Big((R_{jt}-R_t^F)+\rho_{jkt}-c_{jkt}\Big)\]
Franchise value:
\[
V_{jt}=\mathbb{E}\Big[\sum_{s=t}^{\infty}\beta^{\,s-t}\pi_{js}\Big].
\]
Equilibrium: stationary Markov perfect equilibrium in pure strategies (BBL approach).
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Banks: flow profits and franchise value}
State space: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Exogenous public state ($\Omega_{kt}$): federal funds rate and $\delta_{jkt}$
	\item Endogenous public states($W_{kt}$): market shares
	\item Private states ($\xi_{kt}$): iid cost shifters
\end{itemize}





\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Estimation Strategy}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Estimation: three steps}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Sleepiness} $\phi_{kt}$: combine account openings/turnover microdata and deposit autocorrelation in SoD using a control function.
	\item \textbf{Demand} (active depositors): compute active market shares using $\phi_{kt}$, estimate $(\alpha,\delta_{jkt})$ via Berry (1994).
	\item \textbf{Costs / supply} (dynamic game): estimate reduced-form spread policy functions; recover cost parameters via BBL (Bajari et al.\ 2007) using the condition that observed policies maximize franchise value.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 1: identifying sleepiness from account openings}
Under the model, new accounts identify active demand:
\[
NewDep_{\ell j t} = (1-\phi(\cdot))M_{\ell t}s^{Active}_{jt}(1-s_{j,t-1}).
\]
Rearrangement yields a moment linking turnover to sleepiness:
\[
1-\frac{Dep_{\ell j,t-1}}{Dep_{\ell jt}}\frac{NewDep_{\ell jt}}{1-s_{j,t-1}}
=
\phi(\cdot)
+
e_{\ell jt}.
\]
Key finding: $\approx 94\%$ of depositors are inactive each year; sleepiness falls when the lagged fed funds rate is higher (people ``wake up'' when returns to shopping rise).
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 1: autocorrelation and control function}
Autocorrelation in deposits confounds sleepiness with persistent quality.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Control function: regress spreads on cost shifters (salaries, fixed expenses) to recover latent demand:
	\[
	\rho_{jkt} = \lambda Z_{jt} + v_{jkt}.
	\]
	\item Second stage: regress deposits on lagged deposits and the control:
	\[
	Dep_{jkt} = (\Upsilon_1'S_{kt}+\Upsilon_2'X_{kt})(1+R_{t-1}^F-\rho_{jk,t-1})Dep_{jk,t-1}+H(v_{jkt})+\iota_{jkt}.
	\]
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 2: demand among active depositors}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use estimated $\phi_{kt}$ to compute each bank’s \textit{active} market share $s^{Active}_{jkt}$.
	\item Estimate price sensitivity $\alpha$ and qualities $\delta_{jkt}$ using Berry (1994).
	\item Result: accounting for sleepiness makes deposit demand substantially more elastic (about 33--34\% higher elasticity relative to treating all depositors as active).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 3: dynamic supply and costs (BBL)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Parameterize (net) marginal costs:
	\[
	c_{jkt}=\omega+\zeta R_t^F+\gamma'Z_{jt}+\chi_{jkt}.
	\]
	\item Flexibly estimate policy function mapping states to spreads (first-order polynomial in states + competitor sums).
	\item Use BBL (Bajari et al.\ 2007): forward-simulate franchise values under the observed policy and many deviations; pick cost parameters that rationalize observed policy as optimal.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Main Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Result 1: sleepiness raises average markups}
Counterfactual: eliminate sleepiness (all depositors always active) $\Rightarrow$ static competition.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Average markups would be \textbf{53\% lower} without sleepiness:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item From about \textbf{68 bps} (baseline) to about \textbf{32 bps} (no sleepiness).
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\centering
%\maybegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Figures/fig_markups_baseline_vs_nosleepy.pdf}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Result 2: sleepiness makes markups procyclical}
\begin{itemize}
	\item With sleepiness, markups rise more when the short rate rises (invest-versus-harvest incentives vary over the cycle).
	\item Quantitatively:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item At the zero lower bound: average markup $\approx$ 31 bps.
		\item In 2023 (short rates $>$ 5\%): average markup $\approx$ 127 bps.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\centering
%maybegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Figures/fig_markup_cyclicality.pdf}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Result 3: concentration–markup relationship changes in the dynamic model}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In static/reduced-form views, markups often appear increasing in concentration (HHI).
	\item Accounting for dynamic competition:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Eliminates the increasing relationship between concentration and markups that obtains under static competition.
		\item Markups can be high even in low-HHI areas because banks endogenously harvest sleepy bases.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\centering
%\maybegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Figures/fig_hhi_markups_static_vs_dynamic.pdf}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Result 4: sleepiness explains a large share of deposit franchise value}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Under the static counterfactual (no sleepiness), average deposit franchise value falls by about \textbf{58\%}.
	\item Interpretation: sleepiness accounts for more than half of the value of the average bank’s deposit franchise.
\end{itemize}
\centering
%\maybegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Figures/fig_franchise_value_decomposition.pdf}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Result 5: heterogeneity—who benefits most from sleepiness?}
Sleepiness dependence is larger for banks with low quality or high costs.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Moving from 25th to 75th percentile of product quality reduces sleepiness dependence by about 10.4 pp (62\% $\rightarrow$ 51.6\%).
	\item Moving from 25th to 75th percentile of marginal costs increases sleepiness dependence by about 3.4 pp (54.9\% $\rightarrow$ 58.3\%).
\end{itemize}

%\maybegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{Figures/fig_heterogeneity_quality_cost.pdf}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Result 6: financial stability implications}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Convert franchise value losses into risk-neutral default probabilities (using CDS-based approach in the paper).
	\item For the three largest deposit-taking banks (JPM, BofA, Wells Fargo):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Default probabilities rise by about 10 pp in normal times.
		\item Increase by \textbf{more than 20 pp} during the 2022--2023 tightening cycle absent sleepy deposits.
	\end{itemize}

\section{Counterfactuals and Extensions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Policy counterfactual: making deposit competition static}
Motivation: FCA and other regulators seek more pass-through to depositors (higher deposit betas).
\begin{itemize}
	\item Paper’s static counterfactual is a limiting case: constrain betas to unity $\Rightarrow$ banks compete on constant spreads rather than time-varying ones.
	\item Mechanism: eliminates dynamic invest-versus-harvest tradeoff induced by depositor sleepiness.
	\item Quantitative effects (from earlier results): lower markups, lower franchise value, higher fragility.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Extension 1: price discrimination via bonuses}
Allow banks to offer different terms to new vs incumbent depositors.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Helps discriminate between active (new) and inactive (incumbent) depositors, but imperfectly.
	\item Estimated customer acquisition costs are large:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Roughly \textbf{15 cents} to attract an additional \textbf{dollar} of deposits from new depositors.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Main conclusions about sleepiness and dynamic competition remain similar.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Extension 2: forward-looking depositors}
Re-estimate demand when active depositors are forward-looking.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Adds an additional product characteristic: discounted expected utility of remaining asleep with today’s choice.
	\item Demand becomes more elastic relative to myopic baseline.
	\item Qualitative conclusions about sleepiness/markups/franchise value remain similar.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Retail depositors are extremely inactive; most switching is not active shopping.
	\item A dynamic model with sleepiness rationalizes invest-versus-harvest incentives.
	\item Sleepiness substantially raises average markups and makes them procyclical.
	\item Dynamic competition changes the mapping from concentration to markups.
	\item Sleepiness explains a large share of deposit franchise value and matters for stability.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

 \begin{frame}{Comments}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Banks are multi-product firms; low prices might not only reflect inves-harvest but also cross-subsidization from other products (e.g., credit cards, mortgages)
	\item Banks use introductory pricing, the invest-harvest tradeoff might not be the most important
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Price discrimination could be a first order concer 
		% if banks can set introductory pricing for new depositors and set a price for all the old customers, then when increasing prices they trade off the active customers who switch with the inactive who dont
		\item Spread increasing on time 
		% in the model if a consumer who has been for long with a bank has a high sleepiness likelihood, hence the bank should increase the spread for them. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Intensive margin: people do not close account they might stop using them
\end{itemize}
